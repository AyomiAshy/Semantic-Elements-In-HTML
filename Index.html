                <h1>Kizaru</h1>
                <p style="color: orange;font-weight: bold;">Borsalino, more commonly known by his alias Kizaru, is an Admiral in the Marines.After Kuzan resigned from the Marines and Sakazuki was promoted to Fleet Admiral, Kizaru is now the only remaining Admiral from the previous trio.

                    He was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the Straw Hats' initial encounter with Aokiji.[2] Because of his actions, Kizaru can be considered the secondary antagonist of the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, one of the two secondary antagonists of the Marineford Arc (along with Kuzan), and a major antagonist of the Egghead Arc.Kizaru is an incredibly tall, relatively slim man, roughly the same size as the other two ex-Admirals Aokiji and Akainu.[10] He is of middle age with a moderate amount of wrinkles on his face, short curly black hair, and a very thin beard.[1] He is older than the other two Admirals, a fact that is reflected in his looks.

                    Kizaru's standard outfit consists of a yellow striped suit with a Marine coat draped over his shoulders like a cape, with his arms not in its sleeves.[1] Kizaru also wears pure white shoes, gold-amber tinted sunglasses, and a dark green shirt with a mauve tie under his yellow suit. There is a tiny Black Den Den Mushi on his left wrist, like a wristwatch, underneath the sleeve of his suit. He is generally seen wearing a relaxed grin on his face.[8]
                    
                    As a child, he wore a large yellow striped hat, much like his older self's suit, a yellow vest and he still had his grin that he maintained throughout his life. In his early days as a Marine, he wore a knit cap with the Marine emblem on it, sunglasses, and also a normal Marine jacket with a striped undershirt.
                    
                    In his youth, he wore a Marine skull cap and had no facial hair.
                    
                    Twenty-seven years before the start of the series, he wore a typical Marine cap, and his beard was not as full as it is currently. He also lacked the gold amber-tinted sunglasses, shirt, and tie, which he was last seen wearing.When he was seen stationed at Marineford as a Vice Admiral thirteen years before the start of the series, he was sporting a large dark grey hat, dark gloves and had a cigarette in his mouth.[3] His trademark pinstriped suit was light grey, matching his tie, while his thin beard was not yet present.[12]

                    For a time, his appearance after the timeskip in the anime deviated from that in the manga, as his character reappeared in the anime before being reintroduced in the manga, where he was given a different design than what Eiichiro Oda eventually decided to use for the manga. In One Piece Film: Z, he was shown wearing a different pinstripe suit, and instead of a collared shirt and tie, had on a viridian green turtleneck. The appearance he had here was also seen on his half-completed wax likeness made by Diego in Episode of Luffy and used for One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2 and One Piece: Unlimited World Red. This served as his acting post-timeskip appearance, until he made his first actual appearance after the timeskip in the manga in Chapter 802, which saw him in a pinstripe suit similar to the one shown for his anime appearances, but not entirely sharing the same design, nor was it the one he had worn before the timeskip. He also continued wearing a collared shirt and tie instead of a turtleneck.
                    
                    In Egghead Arc, Kizaru wears a black and yellow striped suit, an orange shirt with a brown tie and retained his Marine coat with yellow sleeves.
                    
                    In One Piece Film: Red, Kizaru wears a black and yellow striped suit, and a Marine coat with golden sleeves and innards. Along with his regular dark green shirt and mauve tie.</p>
